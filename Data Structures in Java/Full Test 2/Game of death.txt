Game of death



Send Feedback
There are n people standing in a circle (numbered clockwise 1 to n) waiting to be executed. The counting 
begins at point 1 in the circle and proceeds around the circle in a fixed direction (clockwise). In each 
step, a certain number of people are skipped and the next person is executed. The elimination proceeds 
around the circle (which is becoming smaller and smaller as the executed people are removed), until only 
the last person remains, who is given freedom.
Given the total number of persons n and a number k which indicates that k-1 persons are skipped and kth 
person is killed in circle.
Find the position of last person to survive.
Sample input 1:
4 2
Sample output 1:
1
(Skip 1 , kill 2 , Skip 3 , Kill 4)
(Skip 1 , Kill 4, So 1 survives)
Sample input 2:
50 10
Sample output 2:
36
