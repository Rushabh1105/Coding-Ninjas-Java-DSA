Minimum Count



Send Feedback
Given an integer N, find and return the count of minimum numbers, sum of whose squares is equal to N.
That is, if N is 4, then we can represent it as : {1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2} and {2^2}. Output will be 1, 
as 1 is the minimum count of numbers required.
Note : x^y represents x raise to the power y.
Input Format :
Integer N
Output Format :
Required minimum count
Constraints :
1 <= N <= 50
Sample Input 1 :
12
Sample Output 1 :
3
Sample Output 1 Explanation :
12 can be represented as :
1^1 + 1^1 + 1^1 + 1^1 + 1^1 + 1^1 + 1^1 + 1^1 + 1^1 + 1^1 + 1^1 + 1^1
1^1 + 1^1 + 1^1 + 1^1 + 1^1 + 1^1 + 1^1 + 1^1 + 2^2
1^1 + 1^1 + 1^1 + 1^1 + 2^2 + 2^2
2^2 + 2^2 + 2^2
As we can see, the output should be 3.
Sample Input 2 :
9
Sample Output 2 :
1



public class Solution {

		return helper(n);
	}

	public static int helper( int n ){
		if( n < 3 ){
			return n;
		}

		int sq =(int) Math.sqrt(n);
		if( sq*sq == n ){
			return 1;
		}

		int ans = n;
		for( int i = 1; i*i < n; i++ ){
			ans = Math.min( ans, 1+helper( n-(i*i) ) );
		}

		return ans;
	}
